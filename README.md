# Daily Coding Problem

Problems from https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/, they send one to your email every day.

Repo of my attempts to solve the daily problem. I don't have the premium version so I don't have the solutions. I'm not sure if they provide a set of test cases.

### Coming Soon
A way to test, given many inputs and expected outputs in the template solution file.
