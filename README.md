# Daily Coding Problem

Problems from https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/, they send one to your email every day.

Repo of my attempts to solve the daily problem. I don't have the premium version so I don't have the solutions. I'm not sure if they provide a set of test cases.

### Coming Soon
A way to test, given many inputs and expected outputs in the template solution file.

### Getting Started
1. Optional: Create a virtual environment
2. ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` or ```pip install numpy```
    - some solutions might use numpy, although usually you would try to solve a coding problem without extra libs.
3. Must be inside ./problems when you run the python files, or else importing helpers won't work.
